Description: AFL binary instrumentation
 E9AFL is a tool for automatically adding American Fuzzy Lop (AFL)
 instrumentation to existing binary code using static binary rewriting.  This
 makes it possible to add AFL instrumentation to programs without
 recompilation, and is useful for cases where the source code is not available
 (i.e. commercial software).
 .
 E9AFL is designed to be scalable: it is based on the E9Patch static binary
 rewriting tool that can scale to very large software.  E9AFL implements
 several optimizations so that fuzzing speed is comparable to source-level
 instrumentation with afl-gcc.
